      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="small">Last updated: January 14, 2026</p>

      <h2>1. Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Damascus Maker is a crafting/design utility for creating and previewing Damascus-style pattern recipes. The app is designed
        to work offline. It does not require an account, does not include advertising, and does not transmit your recipes or
        inputs to external servers.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Information Collection</h2>
      <p>
        The app does not collect personal information, contact details, device identifiers, or usage analytics for the developer.
        The app does not request access to your location, photos, microphone, camera, contacts, or Bluetooth.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Tracking</h2>
      <p>The app does not track you across apps and websites, and it does not use advertising SDKs.</p>

      <h2>4. On-Device Storage</h2>
      <p>
        The app may store your settings and/or saved recipes locally on your device so they remain available between launches.
        This data stays on your device and is not transmitted by the app.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: if you enable iOS device backups (e.g., iCloud Backup or encrypted Finder/iTunes backup), Apple may include app data
        in those backups. The developer does not receive that data.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Third-Party Access</h2>
      <p>
        The app does not embed third-party analytics SDKs, advertising frameworks, or tracking libraries, and it does not share
        your data with third parties.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        The app does not knowingly collect personal data from children. Because it does not collect data, it is suitable for all
        ages.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        If the app’s functionality changes in a way that affects privacy, this policy will be updated with a new effective date.
      </p>
